## About

A digital breaking journal for tracking training progress. Keep track of your training sessions and make sure every workout stays fresh with user-generated drills.

## Background

As a beginner dancer, keeping track of my growth motivates me to explore and expound on my skills.

As a dancer who is constantly looking to improve, I’ve made training an inextricably apart of my life.

As a dancer who is hyper-aware of sports injuries and the importance of safe movement, all of my warm ups and stretching routine requires documentation for analysis.

/I wanted to marry my love of web development with my love of dance to create a tool that helps me accomplish my goals./
